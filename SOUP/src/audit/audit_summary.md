**Audit Summary — Unused & Duplicate Code (initial pass)**

- Unused private-field candidates: 256 (generated by repo scan). See `src/unused_private_fields_candidates.txt` (raw) and `src/unused_private_fields_report.txt` (report).
- Top-30 candidates: `src/vetted_unused_private_fields_top30.csv` (preliminary recommendations included).
- Duplicate XAML keys: quick scan found >200 `x:Key` usages; notable collisions: `CardStyle`, `WidgetElevatedCardStyle` (renamed in some features already).

Recommendations / next steps:
1. Manual vetting of the 256 private-field candidates to exclude false positives (XAML bindings, reflection, source-generated uses). Focus first on fields with zero code references and not backing auto-properties.
2. Create a conservative PR removing only highest-confidence unused fields (e.g., private fields with zero references and no observable property/getter). Run full solution build and smoke tests.
3. Consolidate common style keys: move truly global styles into `Themes/ModernStyles.xaml` and rename view-local keys with a module prefix to avoid accidental collisions.
4. Add Roslyn analyzers (IDE/CI) to flag unused private fields and unreachable code automatically.

Files created by this audit:
- `src/vetted_unused_private_fields_top30.csv` — first 30 candidates with quick recommendations.
- `src/audit/duplicate_xaml_keys_found.txt` — quick notes on duplicate keys.
- `src/audit/audit_summary.md` — this file.

Would you like me to:
- (A) Generate a full vetted CSV for all 256 candidates (mark high-confidence removals), or
- (B) Produce a conservative PR that removes only the top 10 high-confidence unused fields and runs a full build?
