Full Integration (legacy instructions)

The following instructions were the previous guidance for manually integrating the standalone module projects into this unified app. They were preserved here on 2025-10-28 before the legacy projects were archived.

To fully integrate each module (original instructions):

1. **ExpireWise**: Copy files from `../EXPTRACK/src/renderer/`
2. **Allocation Buddy**: Copy files from `../AB/NewAB/src/`
3. **Essentials Buddy**: Copy files from `../ESSB/webapp/`

Then adapt file paths and dependencies for the unified structure.

If you need to restore original sources, check `d:\\CODE\\Beta\\archive` for the zipped backups and archived folders.
